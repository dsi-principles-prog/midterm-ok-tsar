#### model setup

set up model starting from un cleaned data and finishing off with a df that contains all feature engineered features
```{r}
model1 <- s_data %>% 
  merge_dfs(p_data) %>% 
  mean_by_state(c("killed","wounded")) %>% 
  sum_by_state(c("killed", "wounded")) %>% 
  per_1M_by_state()
```

#### test model setup
test to make sure all the feature engineered columns are in the model setup
```{r}
model1 %>%
  assert_colnames(
    c(
      "state",
      "killed_per_1M",
      "wounded_per_1M",
      "killed_state_sum",
      "wounded_state_sum",
      "killed_statemean",
      "wounded_statemean",
      "state_name",
      "killed",
      "wounded",
      "population",
      "date",
      "name_semicolon_delimited",
      "city",
      "sources_semicolon_delimited"
    ),
    only_colnames=TRUE
  )
```
